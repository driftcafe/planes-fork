This is a [Moose](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose) project bootstrapped with [`moose init`](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/reference/moose-cli#init)

[Demo Application](https://planes-phi.preview.boreal.cloud/)

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

1. Install Moose: `bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose`
2. Install dependencies: `cd moose && npm install`
3. Run Moose: `moose dev`
4. In a new terminal, install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
5. Configure the frontend API URL (optional):
   * Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env.local`
   * Edit `.env.local` and set
     * `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your backend URL
       * For local development, the default is `http://localhost:4000`
       * For production deployments, update to your Boreal URL (e.g., `https://514-demos-planes-main-59be4.boreal.cloud`)
     * `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_SERVER_URL` to your MCP URL
       * For local development, the default is `http://localhost:4000`
       * For production deployments, update to your Boreal URL (e.g., `https://514-demos-planes-main-59be4.boreal.cloud`)
     * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your private Anthropic API key
6. Run frontend: `npm run dev`

You are ready to go!

You can start editing the app by modifying primitives in the `app` subdirectory. The dev server auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project gets data from <http://adsb.lol>.

## Chat Feature

This project includes an AI-powered chat interface that allows you to query aircraft tracking data using natural language.

### Usage

1. Start the backend (moose) and frontend servers (see Getting Started above)
2. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click the floating chat button in the bottom-right corner
4. Ask questions about your aircraft data in natural language

### Example Questions

* "How many aircraft are being tracked?"
* "Show me the 5 highest flying aircraft"
* "Which aircraft are on autopilot?"
* "What flights are currently on approach?"

### Features

* **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
* **SQL Transparency**: View the generated SQL queries
* **Data Visualization**: Results displayed in formatted tables
* **Multi-Step Reasoning**: See Claude's thought process across multiple iterations

### Architecture

The chat feature uses:

* **Frontend**: NextJS project containing a chat sidebar with Vercel's [ai-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-sdk) components
* **Backend**: Express API w/ MCP server at `/tools`
* **AI Model**: Anthropic Claude (claude-haiku-4-5)
* **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol server for ClickHouse queries
* **Database**: ClickHouse for fast analytics

* Backend documentation: `moose/README.md`
* Frontend documentation: `frontend/README.md`
